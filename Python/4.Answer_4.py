## Answer-4 [Python] :-

import requests
import pandas as pd

# Downloading the data from the provided link
url = "https://nbviewer.org/github/matindra/dataset/blob/main/nasa_data.json"
response = requests.get(url)

# Converting the data into a pandas dataframe
df = pd.read_json(response.content)

# Saving the dataframe to a CSV file
df.to_csv("nasa_data.csv", index=False)

print("Data saved to nasa_data.csv")
